When trying to deploy MVC 4 solution on IIS 7 (Win Server 2008), ensure the following steps.

1. Comment out the default "authorization" tag in web.config to deny anonymous users.
2. Set App Pool to ASP.NET 4.0 Integrated Pipeline.
3. Set "Anonymous Authentication" as "Enabled" and make all others "disabled".
