                7. Remember to upgrade all libraries of jquery, knoockout etc after creating a new
                MVC 3/ 4 Project. using NUGET Package Manager.
            
                8. Also upgrade NUGET Package Manager from time to time
            
                9. For Knockout Bundling = > debug version to be used. keep name as "knockout-3.0.0.debug.js"
                as it is with debug suffix. Minified version fails when optimization is enabled.
            
                10. VS Intellisense does not work if RequireJS AMD is used.

                Dapper.SqlMapper.IDynamicParameters which supports Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleDbType.
                <br />
                <b>Petapoco, ServiceStack.OrmLite & FluentData also has Good Oracle Support.</b>
                <br />
                ServiceStack.OrmLite.Oracle is for Oracle support with OrmLite.
                
                13. To Enable Nuget Package Manager in VS2010, install nuget for VS2010 ultimate from:
                http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c 
                
                14. Enable win powershell 2.0 on VS2010 by downloading Win powershell from
                http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16818 
                Afetr install, it enables Package manager Console and allows downloading packages using
                Nuget commands (ex: Install-package jquery)

                15. The wildcard certificate allows IIS to use the same certificate for all of the sites on 
                a particular port. That takes away the requirement that IIS know which site's certificate to 
                use in decrypting the data.
                Secure server bindings help IIS in securing the wildcard certificate, a requirement for setting this up.
                Thus, it is very possible to have multiple SSL sites on a single server, all sharing the same port.
                
                Steps:
                a) Create wildcard SSL certificate
                b) Create Secure Server Bindings

                16.Before deploying MVC applications, right click on project and "Add Deployable Dependencies"
                
                17.When issuing SSL certificate on IIS web server, ensure to request certificate with the same name as the 
                   website URL.
                  if website URL is https://sdlcdev.nam.nsroot.net, then request SSL cert with name as "sdlcdev.nam.nsroot.net"              

                18. To Deploy ASP.NET 4.0 web application on Windows Server 2008/ R2, follow the steps mentioned below:
                   * confirm that all dll library is having "target platform" set to "Any CPU" in the project properties
                   * Map Application pool in IIS 7.0/ 7.5 to "Classic" Mode.
                   
                   * Note: check URL below to know why "Integrated" mode does not work on IIS 7/ 7.5 for ASP.NET web application

                19. ** using DurandalJS in ASP.NET MVC 4 with razor in VS 2010, Install Nuget Packages in the order shown below
                   * Install-Package HotTowel 
                   * Install-Package AttributeRouting
                   
                   * Basically, durandal is looking for views in "/App/Views/" so we need to add a route that 
                     takes all requests for *.html files for that folder and re-route it to a razor view. 
                     AttributeRouting is the easiest way to perform this.
                   
                   * Durandal works normally with html files and if we need Razor .cshtml views, we have to use AttributeRouting
                     But in this case file minification using weyland will not work.
                     Forget minification if "AttributeRouting" is used with MVC Durandal.
                   
                20. To use Durandal in VS2012, select empty template and install just one package mentioned below
                   * Install-Package Durandal.StarterKit
                   
                   To use Durandal with MVC 4 Razor and VS2010, check link below & install packages as shown in link
                   http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/715041/Durandal-View-s-with-Razor-and-Csharp-ViewModel

                   To Install Unity.MVC4 DI in VS2010 with MVC 4, install Nuget packages in the order as shown below
                   * Install-Package CommonServiceLocator
                   * Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc -Version 4.0.30506
                   * Install-Package Unity.Mvc4 -Version 1.2.0
                
                 Imp Points:
                   * Node.js and NPM installs in Windows 7 Home Premium -- tested
                   * It does not install on Windows XP.
                   * Node.js should be successfully installed to install "Weyland" via "install weyland build" command
                   * Weyland build js file builds successfully after installing "AttributeRouting" (for enabling razor views
                     in durandal apps)
                     It also minifies the files but the newly added routes does not show up in the UI.
                   * Thereby to use weyland's minified build in durandal, it's better to use durandal's html views only.
                     Do not use MVC razor .cshtml views with durandal if you want to leverage weyland build/minification.
                
                21. Use "SlowCheetah" Visual Studio Extension to enable XDT:Transform on app.config files of 
                    Winform applications.
                    
                22. jQuery Datatable cannot load 5000 records in IE 8. Chrome does work sometimes.
                    But both browsers become extremely slow after binding 5000 records.

                    i. Open Command Prompt from Start Menu and execute following command:
                       wmic /namespace:\\root\cimv2 path win32_product where "name like '%%.NET%%'" get version
                       You can copy the above mentioned command and then open Command Prompt, right-click on its 
                       titlebar and select "Edit -> Paste" option. It'll quickly paste the whole command.

                    ii. Wait for a few seconds and it'll show a list of all .NET Framework versions installed in your system.
                
                24. Never UnInstall .net framework (Default installation) from Windows 2008 server/Server R2
                    It uninstalls many things and after installing back lal frameworks, no applications will work
                    
                    If you get into this situation, run the below commands in the Server Coreâ€™s command prompt window to help you recover:

                     DISM.exe /online /enable-feature /all /featurename:NetFx4
                     DISM.exe /online /enable-feature /all /featurename:MicrosoftWindowsPowerShell

                     The above commands will re-install .Net 4.0 and PowerShell on the server. Once PowerShell is installed, you can add the Graphical Shell (Windows Explorer) using the following command:

                     Install-WindowsFeature Server-Gui-Shell, Server-Gui-Mgmt-Infra

                     Once the GUI Shell is installed, you will need to restart the server with the following command:

                     Restart-Computer

                25. Getting IIS to impersonate the windows user to SQL server in an intranet environment
                    <system.web>
                    <authentication mode="Windows" />
                    <authorization>
                        <deny users="?" />
                    </authorization>
                    <identity impersonate="true" />
                  </system.web>
                   <system.webServer>
                    <validation validateIntegratedModeConfiguration="false" />
                   </system.webServer>
                   
                   IIS Authentication Settings

                   Anonymous Authentication = Disabled
                  ASP.NET Impersonation = Enabled
                   Forms Authentication = Disabled
                   Windows Authentication = Enabled
                   
                   IIS App Pool Settings

                   Managed Pipeline = Integrated
                   Identity = domain\username (domain service account)
                  
                 26. If any new feature/ role services are added into Windows 2008 server/ server R2 machines via Server
                     Manager, then after installation go to the directory where .net framework is installed 
                     and execute command aspnet_regiis -i to reinstall script maps for the framework
                     
                27. MVC 4 Web API template does not allow data to be returned in "JSON" by default. It returns xml.
                    Turn off xml using code below. Apply changes in global.asax file right below line 
                    "BundleConfig.RegisterBundles(BundleTable.Bundles);"
                    
                    var config = GlobalConfiguration.Configuration;
                            var xmlFormatter = config.Formatters
                              .Where(f =>
                              {
                                  return f.SupportedMediaTypes.Any(v => v.MediaType == "text/xml");
                              })
                              .FirstOrDefault();
                
                            if (xmlFormatter != null)
                            {
                                config.Formatters.Remove(xmlFormatter);
                            }
                    
                    After turning off xml formatter, IEnumerable<T> OR List<T> can be easily returned from controller
                    without converting to JSON.
                    If MVC razor view is used, then return IEnumerable<T> from dapper and from the controller.
                    Then Bind ienumerable collection in MVC razor view using MVC scaffold templates.
                    
                    If mvc scaffold is not required, then bind in UI using jQuery Ajax & KnockoutJS or other js libraries.
                    directly iterate through ienumerable collection and use KO applybindings.
                    
                     
                28. Few things about MVC web api:
                   * Called via http verbs within the controller.
                   * If multiple Get requests are required in same controller then use "ActionName" attribute
                     over the method name as shown below with "HttpGet" attribute.
                     
                     [System.Web.Http.HttpGet]
                     [System.Web.Http.ActionName("GetData")]
                     public List<T> GetData(string Id)
                   * Then if using angularjs, invoke controller & return promise object from service as shown below :
                     
                     ex=> "api/<contollername>/<actionname>/" + <params>
                     
                     return $http.get("api/<contollername>/GetData/" + id).then(function (result) {
                                return result.data;
                      });
                   * Never mark entity classes with [Serializable] Attribute as  Web API would serialize all the public properties for us.
                     If marked, then we get junk characters with "__backingfield" in the JSON response and nothing would be bound in UI.
