1. Never create web.config within a C# class library dll project.
2. Put all ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["<key>"] code in class library project.
   Add reference to the .dll in Asp.net Web application or MVC Application.
   The key settings will be picked up from the web.config of web app or mvc app automatically.
   
   [ i.e after referencing the dll, the key settings will pe picked up from web.config of consuming app.]
